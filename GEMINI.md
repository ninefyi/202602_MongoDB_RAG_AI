# Directory Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive course on "MongoDB RAG AI with Voyage-AI". The course is structured as a series of Marp-compatible Markdown files, designed for a 3-hour beginner-level workshop. It covers concepts, theory, and hands-on labs.

# Key Files

*   `COURSE.md`: The main file containing all 100 slides for the course. It's designed to be run with Marp.
*   `module1.md`: Slides for Module 1, covering the introduction to AI, LLMs, and RAG.
*   `module2.md`: Slides for Module 2, focusing on MongoDB for RAG and Atlas Vector Search.
*   `module3.md`: Slides for Module 3, introducing Voyage-AI for embeddings and reranking.
*   `module4.md`: Slides for Module 4, a hands-on workshop for building a RAG application.
*   `labs/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks that guide students through the practical labs outlined in the course.
    *   `labs/lab1_mongodb_atlas_setup.ipynb`: Guides through setting up a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
    *   `labs/lab2_data_ingestion.ipynb`: Demonstrates data ingestion into MongoDB with Voyage-AI embeddings.
    *   `labs/lab3_rag_query_flow.ipynb`: Details the RAG query flow using Voyage-AI and MongoDB Vector Search.
    *   `labs/lab4_reranking.ipynb`: Explains how to enhance RAG with Voyage-AI reranking.

# Usage

The primary file, `COURSE.md`, can be used with Marp to generate a slide presentation. The individual `module*.md` files can be used for reviewing or editing specific sections of the course. The course is intended for beginners and provides a step-by-step guide to building a RAG application with MongoDB and Voyage-AI. The Jupyter Notebooks in the `labs/` directory provide hands-on exercises to complement the theoretical content.
